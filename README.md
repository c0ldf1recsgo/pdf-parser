# pdf-parser
This parser is supported by pdfminer
Pdfminer.six is an community maintained fork of the original PDFMiner. It is a
tool for extracting information from PDF documents.
Unlike other PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting
and analyzing text data. Pdfminer.six allows one to obtain
the exact location of text in a page, as well as
other information such as fonts or lines.
It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF files
into other text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensible
PDF parser that can be used for other purposes than text analysis.
